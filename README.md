Nose size is calculated with the widths of both eyes; the average of two widths.
It is because sometimes the two eyes are detected as different sizes, depending on the quality and angle of the camera.
The raidus of the nose is simply the half of it.
Also, we used widths instead of heights to make sure that the nose size is big enough.
